### Guardians. Development of a web application facilitating communication between teachers and guardians.
==========

Guardians is my final degree project. In this project, I wanted to design a web application using all knowledge adquired during the degree. The application helps and simplified daily work for teachers. The teacher can create events, test his students, check the progress of their students and other useful functionality.  The technologies that have been mostly used are Spring MVC and Vaadin.
